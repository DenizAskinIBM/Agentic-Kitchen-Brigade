**Instructions:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Clean all utensils and surfaces.

2. **Prepare the Bread:**
   - Lightly spread butter on one side of each bread slice.
   - Sprinkle a pinch of cayenne pepper and a dash of garlic powder over the buttered side.

3. **Assemble the Sandwiches:**
   - Place a slice of cheese on the unbuttered side of two bread slices.
   - If desired, splash a few drops of beer onto the cheese.

4. **Cook the Sandwiches:**
   - Heat a heavy cast iron skillet or non-stick pan over medium-low heat.
   - Place the assembled sandwiches in the skillet.
   - Press down gently with a spatula for even cooking, then cover with a lid or another heavy pan to simulate a panini press.

   - Carefully flip the sandwiches, pressing down gently.

5. **Optional Cheese Addition:**
   - Add an extra slice of cheese on top of each sandwich if desired.

6. **Finishing Touches:**
   - Carefully remove the sandwiches from the skillet and place them on a cutting board.
   - Allow them to cool slightly for about a minute for easier handling.
   - Cut each sandwich in half and arrange them on plates.
