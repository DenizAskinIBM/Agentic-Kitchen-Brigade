**Ingredients:**

- Cayenne pepper
- Garlic powder
- Beer (optional)

**Tools:**
- Heavy cast iron skillet or non-stick pan
- Spatula
- Lid or another heavy pan

**Preparation Steps:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Ensure all utensils and surfaces are clean.
   - Gather all ingredients and tools needed for the recipe.
   - Make sure the bread, cheese, and butter are at appropriate temperatures for easy handling.

2. **Assembling the Sandwiches:**
   - Lightly spread butter on one side of each bread slice.
   - Sprinkle a pinch of cayenne pepper and a dash of garlic powder over the buttered side.
   - On the unbuttered side of two bread slices, place a slice of cheese.
   - If desired, splash a few drops of beer onto the cheese for a unique flavor.

3. **Cooking:**
   - Heat a heavy cast iron skillet or non-stick pan over medium-low heat.
   - Place the assembled sandwiches in the skillet.
   - Press down gently with a spatula for even cooking, then cover with a lid or another heavy pan to simulate a panini press.
   - Cook until the bread is golden brown and the cheese begins to melt, about 2-3 minutes per side.
   - Carefully flip the sandwiches, pressing down gently.
   - Add an extra slice of cheese on top of each sandwich if desired.
   - Cover again and allow the cheese to melt for another 2 minutes.

4. **Finishing Touches:**
   - Carefully remove the sandwiches from the skillet and place them on a cutting board.
   - Allow them to cool slightly for about a minute.

5. **Serving:**

   - Perform a final quality check on presentation before serving.

6. **Clean-Up:**
   - Clean all used utensils and surfaces.
   - Store any remaining ingredients appropriately.
