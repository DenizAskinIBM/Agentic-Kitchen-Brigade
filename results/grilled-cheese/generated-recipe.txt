**Grilled Cheese Sandwich Recipe**

**Ingredients:**
- 4 slices of bread (your choice of type)
- 4 slices of cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or your preference)
- 4 tablespoons of butter (softened)
- Optional: pinch of cayenne pepper, splash of beer, dash of garlic powder

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Bread:**
    - Lightly spread butter on one side of each bread slice. If you like, sprinkle a pinch of cayenne pepper and a dash of garlic powder over the butter for a kick.

2. **Layer the Cheese:**
    - Place a slice of cheese on the unbuttered side of two bread slices. If you're adventurous, splash a few drops of beer onto the cheese for an extra layer of flavor.
    - Top each slice of cheese with the remaining bread slices, buttered side facing out.

3. **Cook the Sandwiches:**
    - Heat a heavy cast iron skillet or a non-stick pan over medium-low heat.
    - Place the sandwiches in the skillet and cover with a lid or another heavy pan. This will help the cheese melt evenly as it simulates the action of a panini press.
    - Cook until the bread is golden brown and the cheese begins to melt, about 2-3 minutes per side. Flip the sandwiches carefully and press down gently with a spatula for even cooking.

4. **Finish with More Cheese:**
    - Carefully remove the lid and add an extra slice of cheese on top of each sandwich. Cover again and allow the cheese to melt, about another 2 minutes.

5. **Serve:**
    - Once both sides are browned and crispy, remove sandwiches from the skillet.
    - Allow them to cool slightly on a cutting board for about a minute, then cut in half and serve hot with your choice of side, such as a small salad or a bowl of tomato soup.

Enjoy your elevated grilled cheese sandwich, bringing out familiar flavors with a unique twist!
