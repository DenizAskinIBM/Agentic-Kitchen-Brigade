**Roast Chicken with Root Vegetables Recipe**

Ingredients:
- Whole chicken (about 4-5 pounds)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 garlic cloves
- Fresh rosemary sprigs
- 2 onions, chopped
- 3-4 large potatoes, cut into cubes
- 4-5 carrots, cut at an angle
- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 cup red wine
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/8 cup water
- Aluminum foil

Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   - Remove the neck and giblets from the chicken. Rinse the chicken inside and out, then pat dry with paper towels.
   - Sprinkle the cavity of the chicken with salt and pepper.
   - Insert garlic cloves and rosemary inside the cavity.
   - Rub the outside of the chicken with salt and pepper.

2. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C).
   - Line a 9x13 inch baking dish with aluminum foil.
   - Scatter half of the chopped onions on the bottom of the roasting pan.
   - Arrange the potato cubes and carrot slices around the chicken in the baking dish, filling any available space.

3. **Flavor and Marinate:**
   - Pour balsamic vinegar and red wine over the chicken and vegetables, ensuring the chicken is well-coated.
   - Drizzle olive oil over the entire dish.
   - Cover the pan with foil and refrigerate for a few hours or overnight for best flavors.

4. **Roasting the Chicken and Vegetables:**
   - Remove the pan from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about an hour.
   - Place the dish in the oven and bake at 425°F (220°C) for 40-45 minutes, covered with foil.
   - Remove the foil, baste the chicken, and reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C).
   - Continue roasting uncovered for an additional 60-90 minutes, basting every half hour, until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (74°C) and the vegetables are tender.

5. **Rest and Serve:**
   - Remove the chicken from the oven and allow it to rest, covered with a foil tent, for 10-20 minutes.
   - While the chicken rests, strain the pan juices and skim off fat. Boil the juices over medium-high heat to reduce and season to taste.
   - Carve the chicken and serve with roasted vegetables, drizzling the balsamic reduction over the top.

6. **Garnishing (Optional):**
   - If desired, sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley and squeeze a bit of lemon juice over the dish before serving.

Enjoy your delicious, flavorful roast chicken and root vegetables!
