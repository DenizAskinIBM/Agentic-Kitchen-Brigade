To evaluate the quality of the routing and assignment of subtasks to specific kitchen roles in this plan, it's crucial to understand the responsibilities and typical tasks associated with each role in a professional kitchen. Here's a breakdown of the tasks, their alignment with roles, and any recommendations:

### T0:
- **Chef de Cuisine**: It's appropriate for this role to review the recipe and assign tasks as they are generally responsible for overall kitchen management and coordination.
- **Nonce 1**: Gathering ingredients and utensils fits as an untrained role like Nonce 1 typically handles basic prep work that doesn’t require advanced skills.

### T1:
- **Sous Chef**: Rinsing and patting dry the chicken is fitting, but this task is somewhat basic for a Sous Chef, who usually manages kitchen operations and steps in where needed.
- **Commis**: Mincing garlic is a task suited for a Commis, who typically handles prep duties.
- **Entremetier**: Rinsing and peeling vegetables aligns with the Entremetier role, responsible for vegetables and garnishes.

### T2:
- **Chef de Partie**: Cutting potatoes into cubes is appropriate since a Chef de Partie manages specific “parties” or sections.
- **Garde Manger**: Chopping onions fits this role focused on cold dishes, though chopping is fairly universal.
- **Cuisinier**: Seasoning the chicken cavity is fitting, as a Cuisinier handles cooking and flavor profiles.

### T3:
- **Rotisseur**: Placing ingredients inside the chicken is relevant as they are in charge of roasting and grilled items.
- **Saucier**: Rubbing chicken with oil and garlic fits since a Saucier specializes in sauces and flavor profiles.
- **Grillardin**: Seasoning the chicken's exterior suits this role, involved in grilling and roasting.

### T4:
- **Entremetier**: Continuing with vegetable prep by cutting carrots is a natural extension of their responsibilities.
- **Plongeur**: While this role is typically for dishwashing, lining the pan is a simple task that doesn’t detract from their main duties.

### T5:
- **Poissonnier**: While typically dealing with fish and seafood, scattering onions is simple and fits well with task variations.
- **Chef de Partie**: Arranging ingredients in a dish is consistent with their expertise in section management.

### T6:
- **Apprenti**: Measuring and combining is fitting for an entry-level role focused on learning and basic tasks.
- **Saucier**: Pouring a liquid mixture aligns with their specialty in sauces and flavoring components.

### T7:
- **Rotisseur**: Adding liquid to ensure even cooking fits with their responsibility for roasted dishes.

### T8:
- **Entremetier**: Preheating the oven is a basic task appropriate for any role, though oftentimes assigned to assistants or trainees.

### T9:
- **Garde Manger**: Covering dishes could fit as an auxiliary task but is not a primary responsibility. 
- **Tournant**: This versatile role suits placing dishes in the oven as they fill in where needed across stations.

### T10:
- **Rotisseur**: Basting and monitoring roasting fits perfectly for this role specializing in roasted items.
- **Chef de Cuisine**: Monitoring temperature is a responsibility fitting their oversight role.

### T11:
- **Poissonnier**: Continuing to monitor roasting seems slightly out of place, but task reallocation can accommodate team workflow.

### T12:
- **Grillardin**: Basting and additional seasoning during grilling or roasting are typical duties.

### T13:
- **Sous Chef**: Removing hot dishes can be suitable for sous chefs who manage day-to-day operations.
- **Chef de Cuisine**: Tenting the chicken ties into overall task oversight.

### T14:
- **Cuisinier**: Carving the chicken is appropriate for this role, focused on cooking.
- **Saucier**: Drizzling juices relates well to their specialty, enhancing taste with sauces.

### T15:
- **Nonce 1**: Serving food is typical for duties aligning with the more supporting roles in a kitchen.

Overall, the task assignments closely align with each role's responsibilities. However, there are a few instances where tasks could be optimized or better distributed to reflect each role's core duties, like involving the Plongeur and Poissonnier more fittingly. However, given practical kitchen constraints and the flexibility required, this allocation effectively manages the preparation.
