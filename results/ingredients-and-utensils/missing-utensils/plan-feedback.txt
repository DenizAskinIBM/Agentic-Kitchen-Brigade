In evaluating the quality of the task assignments in the provided plan for preparing Roast Chicken with Root Vegetables, it's essential to consider if each subtask is appropriately aligned with the responsibilities and expertise of each kitchen role. Let's examine each role's assignment:


**T0:**
- **Chef de Cuisine 1:** Tasked with reviewing the recipe and planning the workflow, which is appropriate as they typically oversee the kitchen operations and coordinate team activities.
  
- **Sous Chef 1:** Responsible for preheating the oven. While this is a simple task, the sous chef is often the second-in-command and may assist where needed, though it may be more suitable for a kitchen assistant or commis.

- **Garde Manger 1:** Tasked with rinsing and drying the chicken, which aligns with this role as garde manger often handles cold dishes and preliminary preparations.

- **Commis 1:** Assigned to gather ingredients, fitting as commis chefs usually perform basic tasks to assist other chefs.

**T1:**
- **Sous Chef 1:** Minces garlic, a basic task that could have been delegated to a more junior role, but acceptable here given the workflow.

- **Garde Manger 1:** Chops the onion, which is appropriate as part of prep work.

- **Rotisseur 1:** Begins seasoning the chicken, suitable since the rotisseur handles roasting and broiling duties.

**T2:**
- **Garde Manger 1:** Continues with inserting ingredients into the chicken, aligning with prep responsibilities.

- **Entremetier 1:** Peels and cuts vegetables, which is traditionally part of vegetable preparation duties.

**T3:**
- **Chef de Cuisine 1:** Applies seasoning to the chicken; higher roles often ensure key tasks are performed correctly, though this could be done by a sous chef or rotisseur.

- **Plongeur 1:** Lines the baking dish. Plongeur usually handles dishwashing; this task could be reassigned to a commis or a production role.

**T4:**
- **Commis 1:** Scatters onion, fitting for a junior helper role.

- **Entremetier 1:** Arranges vegetables, continuing with their vegetable prep duties.

**T5:**
- **Saucier 1:** Prepares the liquid mixture, appropriate as the saucier often handles sauces and liquids.

- **Cuisinier 1:** Pours the mixture, which could be a task for a junior but involves a fair amount of care in the application.

**T6:**
- **Plongeur 1:** Adding water is more aligned with a commis or kitchen assistant rather than a role focused on cleaning.

**T7:**
- **Rotisseur 1:** Covers the dish with foil, fitting for someone focused on roasting tasks.

- **Chef de Partie 1:** Places the dish in the oven, suitable as they manage specific areas of production.

**T8:**
- **Tournant 1:** Removes foil and bastes chicken. The tournant is adaptable, moving between stations as needed, so this is fitting.

**T9:**
- **Grillardin 1:** Continues roasting, a suitable task since the grillardin handles similar cooking processes.

- **Rotisseur 1:** Checks the internal temperature, appropriate for their role.

**T10:**
- **Chef de Partie 1:** Bastes the chicken, fitting as they manage specific production tasks during the cooking process.

**T11:**
- **Apprenti 1:** Removes the dish from the oven, a good task for gaining experience in handling cooked dishes safely.

**T12:**
- **Chef de Cuisine 1:** Creates a foil tent and monitors resting time. What's expected for the head of the kitchen to ensure final quality.

**T13:**
- **Poissonnier 1:** Carves the chicken, which is less conventional for this role usually focusing on fish, but not an implausible assignment.

- **Saucier 1:** Drizzles juices, appropriate for finishing touches with sauces.

**T14:**
- **Chef de Cuisine 1:** Reviews the completed dish, aligning with their supervisory and quality assurance duties.

Overall, most subtask assignments fit well within the roles' general responsibilities, though some tasks like assisting duties given to the Plongeur and the a-typical carving assigned to Poissonnier could be reconsidered to enhance the task-role alignment further.
