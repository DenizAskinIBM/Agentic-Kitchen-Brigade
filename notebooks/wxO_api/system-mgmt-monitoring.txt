Modify the Default Time Zone on the Device 
To modify the local time zone, include the time-zone statement at the [edit system] hierarchy level: 
[edit] 
user@host# set system time-zone (GMT four-offset | time-zone) 
You can use the GMT /four-offset option to set the time zone relative to UTC (GMT) time. By default, Aour- 
offset is 0. You can configure this to be a value from -14 to +12. 
You can also specify the time-zone value as a string such as PDT (Pacific Daylight Time) or WET (Western 
European Time), or specify the continent and major city. 
@ NOTE: Junos OS complies with the POSIX time-zone standard, which is counter-intuitive 
to the way time zones are generally indicated relative to UTC. A time zone ahead of UTC 
(east of the Greenwich meridian) is commonly indicated as GMT +1; for example, the 
Central European Time (CET) zone is indicated as GMT +1. However, this is not true for 
POSIX time zone designations. POSIX indicates CET as GMT-1. If you include the set 
system time-zone GMT+1 statement for a router in the CET zone, your router time will be set 
to one hour behind GMT, or two hours behind the actual CET time. For this reason, you 
might find it easier to use the POSIX time-zone strings, which you can list by entering set 
system time-zone ?. 
For the time zone change to take effect for all processes running on the router or switch, you must 
reboot the router or switch.


--- Page 9 ---
The following example shows how to change the current time zone to America/New_York: 
[edit] 
user@host# set system time-zone America/New_York 
[edit] 
user@host# show 
system { 
time-zone America/New_York;

Configure Time Zones 
Extend the Default Port Address Range 
By default, the upper range of a port address is 5000. You can increase the range from which the port 
number can be selected to decrease the probability that someone can determine your port number. 
e To configure Junos OS to extend the default port address range, include the source-port statement at 
the [edit system internet-options] hierarchy level: 
[edit] 
user@host# set system internet-options source-port upper-limit upper-limit 
The statement upper-limit uover-limit is the upper limit of a source port address and can be a value from 
5000 through 65,355. 
SEE ALSO 
internet-options


--- Page 10 ---
Select a Fixed Source Address for Locally Generated TCP/IP Packets 
By default, the source address included in locally generated Transmission Control Protocol/IP (TCP/IP) 
packets, such as FTP traffic, and in User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and IP packets, such as Network Time 
Protocol (NTP) requests, is chosen as the local address for the interface on which the traffic is 
transmitted. This means that the local address chosen for packets to a particular destination might 
change from connection to connection based on the interface that the routing protocol has chosen to 
reach the destination when the connection is established. If multiple equal-cost next hops are present 
for a destination, locally generated packets use the 1o@ address as a source. 
To configure the software to select a fixed address to use as the source for locally generated IP packets, 
include the defau/t-address-se/ection statement at the [edit system] hierarchy level: 
[edit system] 
user@host# set system default-address-selection 
If you include the default-address-selection statement in the configuration, the operating system chooses 
the system default address as the source for most locally generated IP packets. The default address is 
usually an address configured on the 1o@ loopback interface. For example, if you specified that SSH and 
telnet use a particular address, but you also have default-address selection configured, the system default 
address is used. 
Rebooting and Halting a Device

Configure the Hostname of a Device in a Configuration Group 
The hostname of a device running Junos OS device is its identification. A network device must have its 
identity established to be accessible on the network. That is perhaps the most important reason to have 
a hostname, but a hostname also has other purposes. 
Junos OS uses the configured hostname as part of the command prompt and to prepend log files and 
other accounting information. The hostname is also used anywhere else where knowing the device 
identity is important. For these reasons, we recommend that you provide hostnames that are descriptive 
and memorable.


--- Page 13 ---
You can configure the hostname at the [edit system] hierarchy level. Optionally, instead of configuring the 
hostname at the [edit system] hierarchy level, you can use a configuration group, as shown in this 
procedure. This is a recommended best practice for configuring the hostname, especially if the device 
has dual Routing Engines. This procedure uses groups called re@ and rel as an example. 
@ NOTE: If you configure hostnames that are longer than the CLI screen width, regardless 
of the terminal screen width setting, the commit operation occurs successfully. Even if 
the terminal screen width is less than the hostname length, the commit is successful. 
To set the hostname by using a configuration group: 
1. Include the host-name statement at the [edit groups group-name system] hierarchy level. 
The Aostname value must be less than 256 characters. 
[edit groups group-name system] 
host-name hostname; 
For example: 
[edit groups reQ system] 
root@# set host-name san-jose-routerQ 
[edit groups rel system] 
root@# set host-name san-jose-router1 
2. If you used one or more configuration groups, apply the configuration groups, substituting the 
appropriate group names. 
For example: 
[edit] 
user@host# set apply-groups [re@ re1] 
3. Commit the changes. 
[edit] 
root@# commit


--- Page 14 ---
The hostname appears in the device CLI prompt. 
san-jose-routerQ# 
Mapping the Hostname of the Switch to IP Addresses 
To map a hostname of a switch to one or more IP addresses, include the inet statement at the [edit 
system static-host-mapping /ostname] hierarchy level: 
[edit system] 
static-host-mapping { 
hostname { 
inet [ addresses ]; 
alias [ aliases ]; 
hostname is the name specified by the host-name statement at the [edit system] hierarchy level. 
For each host, you can specify one or more aliases.

--- Page 16 ---
A Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed hierarchical system that converts hostnames to IP 
addresses. The DNS is divided into sections called zones. Each zone has name servers that respond to 
the queries belonging to their zones. 
DNS Components 
DNS includes three main components: 
e DNS resolver: Resides on the client side of the DNS. When a user sends a hostname request, the 
resolver sends a DNS query request to the name servers to request the hostname's IP address. 
e Name servers: Processes the DNS query requests received from the DNS resolver and returns the IP 
address to the resolver. 
e Resource records: Data elements that define the basic structure and content of the DNS. 
DNS Server Caching 
DNS name servers provide a hostname's IP address to users. The TTL field in the resource record defines 
the period for which DNS query results are cached. When the TTL value expires, the name server sends 
a fresh DNS query and updates the cache. 
Configure a DNS Name Server for Resolving Hostnames into Addresses 
You use Domain Name System (DNS) name servers to resolve hostnames to IP addresses. 
Before you begin, configure your name servers with the hostname and an IP address for your Juniper 
Networks device. It does not matter which IP address you assign as the address of your device in the 
name server, as long it is an address that reaches your device. Normally, you would use the management 
interface IP address, but you can choose the loopback interface IP address or a network interface IP 
address. You can even configure multiple addresses on the name server. 
For redundancy, as a best practice, configure access to multiple name servers. You can configure a 
maximum of three name servers. The approach is similar to the way Web browsers resolve the names of 
a website to its network address. 
You can use Junos OS to configure one or more domain names. The software uses these domain names 
to resolve hostnames that are not fully qualified (that is, hostnames for which the domain names are 
missing). Being able to configure domain names is convenient because you can use a hostname in 
configuring and operating the software without the need to reference the full domain name. After 
adding name server addresses and domain names to your configuration, you can use DNS resolvable 
hostnames in your configurations and commands instead of IP addresses. 
11


--- Page 17 ---
12 
Optionally, instead of configuring the name server at the [edit system] hierarchy level, you can use a 
configuration group, as shown in this procedure. This is 
a recommended best practice for configuring the 
name server. 
You can route traffic between a management routing instance and a DNS name server. After you 
configure a routing instance at the [edit system name-server server-ip-address] hierarchy level, the name 
server becomes reachable through this routing instance. 
@) 
NOTE: This management routing instance option is not supported for SRX Series 
Firewalls. 
To enable a management routing instance for DNS, use the following configuration: 
user@host# set system management-instance 
user@host# set routing-instances mgmt_junos description description 
user@host# set system name-server server-ip-address routing-instance mgmt_junos 
If you've configured the name server using a configuration group, use the [edit groups group-name system 
name-server] hierarchy level, which is a recommended best practice for configuring the name server. 
To configure the device to resolve hostnames into addresses: 
1. Reference the IP addresses of your name servers. 
[edit groups group-name system] 
name-server { 
address; 
The following example shows how to reference two name servers: 
[edit groups global system] 
user@host# set name-server 192.168.1.253 
user@host# set name-server 192.168.1.254 
user@host# show 
name server { 
192.168.1.253; 
192.168.1.254; 
2. (Optional) Configure the routing instance for DNS.


--- Page 18 ---
13 
The following example shows how to configure the routing instance for one of the name servers: 
[edit groups global system] 
user@host# set name-server 192.168.1.253 routing-instance mgmt_junos 
Remember to also configure the following: 
® management-instance statement at the [edit system] hierarchy level 
e routing-instance statement at the [edit routing-instances] hierarchy level 
. (Optional) Configure the name of the domain in which the device itself is located. 
This is a good practice. The software then uses this configured domain name as the default domain 
name to append to hostnames that are not fully qualified. 
[edit system] 
domain-name domain-name; 
The following example shows how to configure the domain name: 
[edit groups global system] 
user@host# set domain-name company.net 
user@host# show 
domain-name company .net; 
. (Optional) Configure a list of domains to be searched. 
If your device can reach several different domains, you can configure a list of domains to be searched. 
Junos OS then uses this list to set an order in which it appends domain names when searching for the 
IP address of a host. 
[edit groups global system] 
domain-search [ domain-list ]; 
The domain list can contain up to six domain names, with a total of up to 256 characters.


--- Page 19 ---
14 
The following example shows how to configure three domains to be searched. This example 
configures the software to search the company.net domain, next the domainone.net domain, and 
finally the domainonealternate.com domain when attempting to resolve unqualified hosts. 
[edit groups global system] 
domain-search [ company.net domainone.net domainonealternate.com ] 
5. If you used a configuration group, apply the configuration group, replacing global with the appropriate 
group name. 
[edit] 
user@host# set apply-groups global 
6. Commit the configuration. 
user@host# commit 
7. Verify the configuration. 
If you've configured your name server with the hostname and an IP address for your device, you can 
issue the following commands to confirm that DNS is working and reachable. You can either use the 
configured hostname to confirm resolution to the IP address or use the IP address of your device to 
confirm resolution to the configured hostname. 
user@host> show host host-name 
user@host> show host /host-ip-address 
For example: 
user@host> show host device.example.net 
device. example. net 
device.example.net has address 192.168.187.1 
user@host> show host 192.168.187.1 
10.187.168.192.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer device.example.net.

ICMP redirect, also known as protocol redirect, is 
a mechanism used by switches and routers to convey 
routing information to hosts. Devices use protocol redirect messages to notify the hosts on the same 
data link of the best route available for a given destination. 
Understanding Protocol Redirect Messages 
Protocol redirect messages inform a host to update its routing information and to send packets on an 
alternate route. Suppose a host tries to send a data packet through a switch S1 and $1 sends the data 
packet to another switch, $2. Also, suppose that a direct path from the host to S2 is available (that is, the 
host and S2 are on the same Ethernet segment). $1 then sends a protocol redirect message to inform the 
host that the best route for the destination is the direct route to S2. The host should then send packets 
15


--- Page 21 ---
directly to S2 instead of sending them through S1. S2 still sends the original packet that it received from 
S1 to the intended destination. 
Refer to RFC-1122 and RFC-4861 for more details on protocol redirecting. 
@ NOTE: 
e Switches do not send protocol redirect messages if the data packet contains routing 
information. 
e All EX series switches support sending protocol redirect messages for both IPv4 and 
IPv6 traffic. 
Disable Protocol Redirect Messages 
By default, devices send protocol redirect messages for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. For security reasons, 
you may want to disable the device from sending protocol redirect messages. 
To disable protocol redirect messages for the entire device, include the no-redirects or no-redirects-ipv6 
statement at the [edit system] hierarchy level. 
e For IPv4 traffic: 
[edit system] 
user@host# set no-redirects 
e For IPv6 traffic: 
[edit system] 
user@host# set no-redirects-ipv6 
To re-enable the sending of redirect messages on the device, delete the no-redirects statement (for IPv4 
traffic) or the no-redirects-ipv6é statement (for IPvé6 traffic) from the configuration. 
To disable protocol redirect messages on a per-interface basis, include the no-redirects statement at the 
[edit interfaces interface-name unit logical-unit-number family family] hierarchy level. 
e For IPv4 traffic: 
[edit interfaces interface-name unit logical -unit-number] 
user@host# set family inet no-redirects 
16


--- Page 22 ---
e For IPv6 traffic: 
[edit interfaces interface-name unit logical -unit-number] 
user@host# set family inet6 no-redirects 
Pings 
IN THIS SECTION 
@ 
Disable the Routing Engine Response to Multicast Ping Packets | 17 
@ 
Disable Reporting IP Address and Timestamps in Ping Responses | 17 
Pings use ICMP. A successful ping is when a device sends an ICMP echo request to a target and the 
target responds with an ICMP echo reply. However, there might be situations where you do not want 
your device to respond to ping requests. 
Disable the Routing Engine Response to Multicast Ping Packets 
By default, the Routing Engine responds to ICMP echo requests sent to multicast group addresses. By 
configuring the Routing Engine to ignore multicast ping packets, you can prevent unauthorized persons 
from discovering the list of provider edge (PE) devices in the network. 
To disable the Routing Engine from responding to these ICMP echo requests, include the no-multicast- 
echo statement at the [edit system] hierarchy level: 
[edit system] 
userGhost# set no-multicast-echo 
Disable Reporting IP Address and Timestamps in Ping Responses 
When you issue the ping command with the record-route option, the Routing Engine displays the path of 
the ICMP echo request packets and the timestamps in the ICMP echo responses by default. By 
configuring the no-ping-record-route and no-ping-timestamp options, you can prevent unauthorized persons 
from discovering information about the provider edge (PE) device and its loopback address. 
17


--- Page 23 ---
You can configure the Routing Engine to disable the setting of the record-route option in the IP header of 
the ping request packets. Disabling the record-route option prevents the Routing Engine from recording 
and displaying the path of the ICMP echo request packets in the response. 
To configure the Routing Engine to disable the setting of the record route option, include the no-ping- 
record-route statement at the [edit system] hierarchy level: 
[edit system] 
user@host# set no-ping-record-route 
To disable the reporting of timestamps in the ICMP echo responses, include the no-ping-time-stamp option 
at the [edit system] hierarchy level: 
[edit system] 
user@host# set no-ping-time-stamp 
Source Quench Messages 
When a device is receiving too many or undesired datagrams, it can send a source quench message to 
the originating device. The source quench message signals the originating device to reduce the amount 
of traffic it is sending. 
By default, the device reacts to ICMP source quench messages. To ignore ICMP source quench 
messages, include the no-source-quench statement at the [edit system internet-options] hierarchy level: 
[edit system internet-options] 
no-source-quench; 
To stop ignoring ICMP source quench messages, use the source-quench statement: 
[edit system internet-options] 
source-quench; 
18


--- Page 24 ---
19 
Time-to-Live (TTL) Expiration 
The time-to-live (TTL) value in a packet header determines how long the packet remains traveling 
through the network. The TTL value decrements with each device (or hop) the packet travels through. 
When a device receives a packet with a TTL value of 0, it discards the packet. The TTL expiry message is 
sent using ICMP. 
You can configure your device to use an IPv4 address as the source address for ICMP time-to-live (TTL) 
expiry error messages. This means you can configure the loopback address as the source address in 
response to ICMP error packets. Doing this is useful when you cannot use the device address for 
traceroute purposes because you have duplicate IPv4 addresses in your network. 
The source address must be an IPv4 address. To specify the source address, use the ttl-expired-source- 
address source-address option at the [edit system icmp (System)] hierarchy level: 
[edit system icmp] 
user@host# set ttl-expired-source-address source-address 
This configuration only applies to ICMP TTL expiry messages. Other ICMP error reply messages

To limit the rate at which ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 messages can be generated by the Routing Engine and 
sent to the Routing Engine, include the appropriate rate limiting statement at the [edit system internet- 
options] hierarchy level. 
e For IPv4: 
[edit system internet-options] 
icmpv4-rate-limit bucket-size bucket-size packet-rate packet-rate 
e For IPvé6:

How to Rate Limit ICMPv4 and ICMPvé6 Error Messages | 21 
By default, ICMP error messages for non-TTL-expired IPv4 and IPvé6 packets are generated at the rate of 
1 packet per second (pps). You can adjust this rate to a value that you decide provides sufficient 
information for your network without causing network congestion. 
@ NOTE: For TTL-expired IPv4 or IPv6 packets, the rate for ICMP error messages is not 
configurable. It is fixed at 500 pps. 
Why to Rate Limit ICMPv4 and ICMPvé6 Error Messages 
An example use case for adjusting the rate limit is a data center providing web services. Suppose this 
data center has many servers on the network that use jumbo frames with an MTU of 9100 bytes when 
they communicate to hosts over the Internet. These other hosts require an MTU of 1500 bytes. Unless 
maximum segment size (MSS) is enforced on both sides of the connection, a server might reply with a 
packet that is too large to be transmitted across the Internet without being fragmented when it reaches 
the edge router in the data center. 
Because TCP/IP implementations often have Path MTU Discovery enabled by default with the dont- 
fragment bit set to 1, a transit device will drop a packet that is too big rather than fragmenting it. The 
device will return an ICMP error message indicating the destination was unreachable because the packet 
was too big. The message will also provide the MTU that is required where the error occurred. The 
sending host should adjust the sending MSS for that connection and resend the data in smaller packet 
sizes to avoid the fragmentation issue. 
At high core interface speeds, the default rate limit of 1 pps for the error messages may not be enough 
to notify all the hosts when there are many hosts in the network that require this service. The 
consequence is that outbound packets are silently dropped. This action can trigger additional 
retransmissions or back-off behaviors, depending on the volume of requests that the data center edge 
router is handling on each core-facing interface. 
In this situation, you can increase the rate limit to enable a higher volume of oversized packets to reach 
the sending hosts. (Adding more core-facing interfaces can also help resolve the problem.)


--- Page 26 ---
How to Rate Limit ICMPv4 and ICMPvé6 Error Messages 
Although you configure the rate limit at the [edit chassis] hierarchy level, it is not a chassis-wide limit. 
Instead, the rate limit applies per interface family. This means, for example, that multiple physical 
interfaces configured with family inet can simultaneously generate the ICMP error messages at the 
configured rate. 
@ NOTE: This rate limit takes effect only for traffic that lasts 10 seconds or longer. The rate 
limit is not applied to traffic with a shorter duration, such as 5 seconds or 9 seconds. 
e To configure the rate limit for ICMPv4, use the icmp statement: 
[edit chassis] 
userGhost# set icmp rate-limit rate-limit 
Starting in Junos OS Release 19.1R1, the maximum rate increased from 50 pps to 1000 pps. 
e To configure the rate limit for ICMPv6, use the icmp6 statement: 
[edit chassis] 
userG@host# set icmp6 rate-limit rate-limit 
You must also consider that the rate limit value can interact with your DDoS protection configuration. 
The default bandwidth value for exceptioned packets that exceed the MTU is 250 pps. DDoS protection 
flags a violation when the number of packets exceeds that value. If you set the rate limit higher than the 
current mtu-exceeded bandwidth value, then you must configure the bandwidth value to match the rate 
limit. 
For example, suppose you set the ICMP rate limit to 300 pps: 
user@host# set chassis icmp rate-limit 300 
You must configure the DDoS protection mtu-exceeded bandwidth to match that value. 
user@host# set system ddos-protection protocols exceptions mtu-exceeded bandwidth 300

System Alarms 
Switches provide predefined system alarms that can be triggered by a missing rescue configuration, 
failure to install a license for a licensed software feature, or high disk usage. You can display alarm 
messages by issuing the show system alarms operational mode command. 
For example: The switch might trigger an alarm when disk usage in the /var partition exceeds 75 
percent. A usage level between 76 and 90 percent indicates high usage and raises a minor alarm 
condition, whereas a usage level above 90 percent indicates that the partition is full and raises a major 
alarm condition. 
The following sample output shows the system alarm messages that are displayed when disk usage is 
exceeded on the switch.

Configuring Junos OS to Determine Conditions That Trigger Alarms on 
Different Interface Types 
For the different types of PICs, you can configure which conditions trigger alarms and whether they 
trigger a red or yellow alarm. Red alarm conditions light the RED ALARM LED and trigger an audible 
alarm if one is connected. Yellow alarm conditions light the YELLOW ALARM LED and trigger an audible 
alarm if one is connected. 
@ NOTE: By default, any failure condition on the integrated-services interface (Adaptive 
Services PIC) triggers a red alarm. 
To configure conditions that trigger alarms and that can occur on any interface of the specified type, 
include the alarm statement at the [edit chassis] hierarchy level. 
[edit chassis] 
alarm { 
Interface-type { 
alarm-name (red | yellow | ignore); 
alarm-name 
is the name of an alarm.

following applications, scripts, and utilities that enable you to configure and monitor devices running 
Junos OS: 
e Junos XML Management Protocol Application Programming Interface (API)—Application 
programmers can use the Junos XML Management Protocol API to monitor and configure Juniper 
Networks devices. 
e NETCONF Application Programming Interface (API)—Application programmers can also use the 
NETCONF API to monitor and configure Juniper Networks devices. 
e Junos OS commit scripts—You can define scripts to enforce custom configuration tasks, enforce 
consistency, prevent common mistakes, and more. Every time you commit a new candidate 
configuration, the active commit scripts are called to inspect the new candidate configuration. If a 
configuration violates your custom rules, the script can instruct the Junos OS to perform various 
actions, including making changes to the configuration and generating custom, warning, and system 
log messages. 
e Junos OS Op scripts—You can add your own commands to the operation-mode CLI. You can use 
these scripts to automate troubleshooting of known network problems and correct them. 
e Junos OS event scripts—You can use event scripts to diagnose and fix issues, monitor the overall 
status of the system, and examine errors periodically. Event scripts are similar to op scripts except 
that certain events on the switch will trigger these scripts. 
e CHEF—You can use CHEF automate the provisioning and management of compute, networking, and 
storage resources. Chef for Junos OS provides support for Chef on selected Junos OS devices, 
allowing you to automate common switching network configurations. 
e Puppet—You can use PUPPET for configuration management. Puppet provides an efficient and 
scalable solution for managing the configurations of large numbers of devices. System administrators 
take advantage of Puppet to manage compute resources such as physical and virtual servers.

36 
Passive monitoring is a type of network monitoring used to passively capture traffic from monitoring 
interfaces. When you enable passive monitoring, the device accepts and monitors traffic on the interface 
and forwards the traffic to monitoring tools like IDS servers and packet analyzers, or other devices such 
as routers or end node hosts. 
Passive Monitoring Benefits 
e Provides filtering capabilities for monitoring ingress and egress traffic at the Internet point of 
presence (PoP) where security networks are attached. 
Guidelines for Configuring Passive Monitoring 
e You can only configure passive monitoring at the interface level. Configuration per VLAN or logical 
interface is not supported. 
e A passive monitoring interface cannot be an aggregated Ethernet (AE) interface. 
e Monitoring tools or devices must be directly connected to the switch or router. 
e Packets with more than two MPLS labels and more than two VLAN tags are dropped. 
e Exception packets such as IP packet options, router alert, and TTL expiry packets are treated as 
regular traffic. 
e Ethernet encapsulation is not supported. 
e MPLS family is supported on the PTX10001-36MR, PTX10004, and PTX10008 routers. 
e Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is not supported on the AE bundle connected to the 
monitoring tool or device.

Sample Configuration for PTX10001-36MR, PTX10004, and PTX10008 Routers | 44 
This example shows how to configure passive monitoring on QFX10000 switches. 
Requirements 
This example uses the following hardware and software components: 
e Two routers (R1 and R2) 
e One QFX10002 switch 
e Two devices, directly connected to the switch 
e Junos OS Release 18.4R1 or later 
Overview 
IN THIS SECTION 
@ 
Topology | 38 
This example describes how to configure passive monitoring on the switch. 
In Figure 1 on page 38, et-0/0/2 and et-0/0/4 are configured as passive monitoring interfaces. Packets 
coming into the network are exchanged between Router 1 (R1) and Router 2 (R2) in two directions (R1 
to R2, R2 to R1) and are sent to the monitored interfaces. When traffic is received, a firewall filter 
transfers all packets to a routing instance and forwards the packets to the monitoring tools. The 
interfaces are then grouped into a single logical interface, known as a link aggregation group (LAG) or AE 
bundle. This enables the traffic to be evenly distributed across the monitoring tools effectively 
increasing the uplink bandwidth. If one interface fails, the bundle continues to carry traffic over the 
remaining interfaces. 
Optionally, you can apply symmetric hashing over the passive monitor interfaces for load balancing 
traffic to the monitoring tools. This allows ingress and egress traffic of the same flow to be sent out 
through the same monitored interface. To configure symmetric hashing, include the no-incoming-port 
option under the [edit forwarding-options enhanced-hash-key] hierarchy. Symmetric hashing is enabled and 
disabled at the global level only. Per protocol hashing is not supported.

Configuring Passive Monitoring 
Step-by-Step Procedure 
To configure 
passive monitoring 
1. Configure passive-monitor mode on the switch interfaces: 
[edit 
]] 
user@switch# 
set interfaces et-0/0/2 passive-monitor-mode 
set interfaces et-0/0/2 unit @ family inet filter input pm 
set interfaces et-0/0/4 passive-monitor-mode 
set interfaces et-0/0/4 unit @ family inet filter input pm1 
2. Configure a family inet firewall filter on the passive monitor interfaces to forward the traffic to a 
routing instance. Supported filter actions are accept, reject, count, routing-instance. 
[edit] 
user@switch# 
set firewall family inet filter pmi term t1 from interface et-0/0/4.0 
set firewall family inet filter pmi term t1 then count cl 
set firewall family inet filter pmi term t1 then routing-instance pm_inst 
set firewall family inet filter pm term t1 from interface et-0/0/2.0 
set firewall family inet filter pm term t1 then count c3 
set firewall family inet filter pm term t1 then routing-instance pm_inst


--- Page 45 ---
3. Create a routing-instance with a static route that points to the devices. 
[edit] 
user@switch# 
set routing-instances pm_inst instance-type virtual-router 
set routing-instances pm_inst interface aeQ.0 
set routing-instances pm_inst routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/@ next-hop 198.51.100.1 
4. Configure an AE bundle on the passive monitoring interfaces. 
[edit] 
user@switch# 
set interfaces xe-0/0/9:0 ether-options 802.3ad aed 
set interfaces xe-0/0/9:1 ether-options 802.3ad aeQ 
set interfaces aeQ unit @ family inet address 198.51.100.2/24 arp 198.51.100.1 mac 
00: 10:94:00:00:05 
set routing-instances pm_inst interface aeQ.0 
5. (Optional) Configure symmetric hashing. 
[edit] 
user@switch# 
set forwarding-options enhanced-hash-key inet no-incoming-port 
6. From configuration mode, confirm your configuration by entering the show interfaces command. If 
the command output does not display the intended configuration, repeat the instructions in this 
example to correct it. 
7. If you are done configuring the interfaces, enter commit from configuration mode.

How to Locate a Device or Port Using the Chassis 
Beacon 
IN THIS SECTION 
@ ~~ Turning On the Chassis Beacon For the Default Interval | 46 
@ 
Turning On the Chassis Beacon For a Specified Interval | 47 
By default, when a network port and its associated link are active, the status LED for that port blinks 
green at a rate of 8 blinks per second. With the chassis beacon feature, you can use the request chassis 
beacon command to slow the current rate at which the status LED blinks green to 2 blinks per second. 
The slower and steadier green light acts as a beacon that you, as a network administrator in a remote 
office, can enable to guide a network installer in a busy data center or lab to a Juniper Networks device 
or port on the device. 
You can use the following options with the chassis beacon feature: 
e Turn on the beacon for: 
e 5 minutes (default) 
e Aspecified number of minutes (1 through 120) 
e Turn off the beacon: 
e Immediately 
e After a specified number of minutes (1 through 120) elapses 
You can use these options on all network ports on an FPC or just one network port on an FPC. 
To turn the beacon on or off on a Virtual Chassis, you must: 
e Issue the request chassis beacon command on the primary switch in the Virtual Chassis. 
e When specifying the FPC slot number, use the target Virtual Chassis member number. 
You can slow the rate at which the status LED blinks green to 2 blinks per second. The slower and 
steadier green light acts as a beacon that guides a network installer in a busy data center or lab to a 
Juniper Networks device or port on the device. 
This topic covers the available options in the following use cases:


--- Page 51 ---
46 
Turning On the Chassis Beacon For the Default Interval 
You can turn on the chassis beacon for the default interval, which is 5 minutes. 
1. Turn on the chassis beacon using one of the following commands: 
a. For all network ports on a specified FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number on 
b. For a specified network port on an FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number pic-slot slot-number port port-number 
on 
After you turn on the chassis beacon, you can expect the following behavior: 
e The chassis beacon overrides the current state of the status LED for all or the specified network 
port on the FPC. 
e 
If you turn on the beacon for only one network port, the status LEDs for the remaining network 
ports on the FPC are turned off. 
e Unless you issue a command to explicitly turn off the chassis beacon before the default interval is 
over, it turns off after 5 minutes. The state of the status LED for all ports or the specified port 
returns to the state it was in before you turned on the chassis beacon. 
2. If you want to turn the chassis beacon off before the 5-minute interval is over, use one of the 
following commands: 
a. For all network ports on a specified FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number off 
b. For a specified network port on an FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number pic-slot slot-number port port-number 
off

47 
Turning On the Chassis Beacon For a Specified Interval 
You can turn on the chassis beacon for 1 through 120 minutes. 
1. Turn on the chassis beacon using one of the following commands: 
a. For all network ports on a specified FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number on timer number-of-minutes 
b. For a specified network port on an FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number pic-slot slot-number port port-number 
on timer number-of-minutes 
After you turn on the chassis beacon, you can expect the following behavior: 
e The chassis beacon overrides the current state of the status LEDs for all or one network port on 
the FPC. 
e 
If you turn on the chassis beacon for only one network port, the status LEDs for the remaining 
network ports on the FPC are turned off. 
e The chassis beacon stays on until you explicitly issue a command to turn it off. 
2. You can turn off the chassis beacon immediately or after a specified time interval (1 through 120 
minutes) is over. 
a. To turn off the chassis beacon immediately, use one of the following commands: 
For all network ports on a specified FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number off 
OR 
For a specified network port on an FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number pic-slot slot-number port port-number 
off 
b. To turn off the chassis beacon after a specified time interval of 1 through 120 minutes is over, use 
one of the following commands:


--- Page 53 ---
48 
For all network ports on a specified FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number off timer number-of-minutes 
OR 
For a specified network port on an FPC: 
user@switch> request chassis beacon fpc slot-number pic-slot slot-number port port-number 
off timer number-of-minutes 
After you turn off the chassis beacon, the state of the status LED for all or one port on the FPC 
returns to the state it was in before you turned on the chassis beacon.
