# Client Engineering Git Repo Asset Template

### Provide Project / Asset Overview 

Enhance incident management and resolution by developing a conversational Incident Co-pilot. The solution will automatically generate step-by-step resolution playbooks for common incidents, leveraging historical data and industry best practices to suggest corrective actions or next best steps. It will also trigger predefined workflows to accelerate response times.
In the long term, the goal is to align with TMF standards, driving consistency, while enabling system-assisted, human-led network automation for more efficient and intelligent operations.
